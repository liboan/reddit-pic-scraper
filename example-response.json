This week, we&amp;#39;ll be looking at one titan of a mod. Rarely do you find such a epic-sized mod that fits in so perfectly with the game. All in all, I know what I&amp;#39;m about to say may come across as exceedingly pretentious - but on an anecdotal level, I found playing with Sukritact&amp;#39;s Events and Decisions comparable to playing Civ V pre G&amp;amp;K to post BNW. It&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to play without once you&amp;#39;ve tried it out in-game. Put simply, it&amp;#39;s a system to works so well, and adds so much. However, the craziest thing about this mod, is not the game-changing mechanics it introduces, nor the two new unique abilities it adds to all 43 vanilla civilizations, nor the myriad of in-game eventa, or even the fact that so many custom civs have custom compatibility. No the craziest thing about this seemingly gargantuan mod - is that it weighs only &lt;strong&gt;2.26 MB&lt;/strong&gt;. You have nothing to lose by downloading it. Let&amp;#39;s go into how it works:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=528549\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events and Decisions&lt;/strong&gt; by Sukritact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heavily inspired by the mechanic of the same name in EU4, the Decisions system hopes to inject a bit more historical flavor into the game, and to allow other mod creators to do the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per the article on the Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Decisions are a set of choices a nation can make if certain conditions are met. Each decision has consequences, which can be both positive and negative. A nation never has to take a decision it is always at the players discretion whether to accept a decision or not. Some decisions are nation specific, some are religion specific and some are more generic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mod introduces an &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Enact Decisions Panel&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; accessible through the Diplocorner drop-down. The system is also modular, other mods can come in and introduce, remove or modify any existing decisions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of what the panel looks like in-game: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/3tc3s\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/3tc3s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, the mod does introduce a few other things into the game; many Decisions require Magistrates, a new resource, to be enacted. A number of Magistrates will be provided at the start of the game via the Palace, and more can be gained by constructing the Judicial Court, a new National Wonder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it stands, there are a number of Generic Decisions available to anyone, and 2 Religious Decisions that are designed to change depending on your civ&amp;#39;s majority religion at the time (compatible with Tomatekh&amp;#39;s mods). Each Firaxis civilization also has 2 Civ Specific Decisions, modded civilizations must have their Civ Specific Decisions supplied by their modder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some examples of Modded Civs to try the system out with include the most recent mods from &lt;em&gt;JFD, More Civs, Leugi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Colonialist Legacies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also an Events system, also inspired by EU4 (and partly by Civ 4). With random events enabled an Event will occasionally occur. Events can also be scheduled to occur at a certain time; be triggered by other Events or Decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example of an event can be found here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/bZw5Okj.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/bZw5Okj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra things to note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should also note that the mod is not available on the Steam Workshop due to personal reasons. Manual installation is easy! Just download the file to the MODS folder in Documents/my games/Civilization V and using a program such as 7Zip or Winrar, extract &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Events and Decisions.7z&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; to it&amp;#39;s own folder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=528549\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download Events and Decisions now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want more Mods, but don&amp;#39;t know where to begin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you still looking for more Civilization V Mods to install? &lt;a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261768373\"&gt;Then try out this pack of Mods that I&amp;#39;ve curated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you still looking for more Civilization Beyond Earth Mods to install? &lt;a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=337469198\"&gt;Then try out this pack of Mods that I&amp;#39;ve curated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This pack is a great place to start if you want a list of good High-Quality civs/sponsors and mods to install that aims to maintain intuitive balance whilst not being too overwhelming.
